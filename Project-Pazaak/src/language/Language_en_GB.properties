REGELSTEKST=Pazaak Rules\nThe goal of Pazaak is to have the face up cards total higher than the opponent's cards without exceeding a total of 20. \nThe main deck consists of cards with values in the range of 1 to 10. There are four cards of every value and therefore the main deck is composed of 40 cards. \nThe sidedeck holds 10 cards. Every player has a personal sidedeck (which can be upgraded by buying special cards in the shop). At the start of the game, each player must choose 6 cards. 4 of these cards will be randomly selected. The player can use these cards through a game. Attention, these cards can only be used once during these sets. \nThe oldest player can begin the game. If players are the same age, this will be chosen alphabetically. \n\nGameplay: \nThe first player gets a card from the main deck. \nAfter receiving a card from the main deck, the player might play one of his hand cards. \nThe player holds or ends the turn. \nHolding means, the player isn't allowed to receive or play any card in the current set. The opponent  however is still allowed to draw and play cards. \nIt's the other player's turn. \nThis goes on until both players hold or one of the players ends the turn with having a score of more than 20 ('Bust'). \nThe player who doesn't exceed a total of 20 and has got the highest score wins the set. \nIf in one set the scores of the two players are equal, the set isn't counted at all. \nThe player who wins three sets wins the match. \nSpecial rules: \nIf all 9 card slots are filled with cards and the score is below or equal to 20, the player wins the set. \nThe Tie-Breaker (\u00b11T) card. See Sidedeck selection. \nSidedeck selection\nIn the sidedeck selection panel you can see every card that is available to your sidedeck. The figure in  the lower right corner specifies the quantity of the card. \n\nThe cards have the following characteristics: \n+1 bis +6:	This card adds its value to the current score. \n-1 bis -6:	This card subtracts its value from the current score. \n\u00b11 bis \u00b16:	This card adds or subtracts its value to / from the current score. \n\u00b11T:	If a set is tied, the player will win, in case he plays the card as last. Otherwise it acts like a \u00b11 card. \nD:		This card doubles the value of the last card. \n2&4:	This card changes the sign (positive or negative) of all cards in the game with the value 2 or 4. \n3&6:		The same card as 2&4, but it acts on cards with the value 3 or 6. \n1\u00b12:	This Pazaak sidecard adds or subtracts selectively one or two to / from the current score. \n
